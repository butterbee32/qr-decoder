# QR Decoder

This script decodes Data Matrix codes from images using OpenCV and pylibdmtx.

## Usage

```bash
python decode_datamatrix.py

Then repeat the `git add`, `commit`, and `push` steps to include it.

Let me know if you want to automate this with a shell script or add more files like requirements.txt or test images.
